Powering the observatory was always going to be a problem with it being so far from the house.
Running mains would have meant a lot of digging and somehow getting the cable round to the 
front of the house where the fuse box is.  For that reason I decided to go with battery
power and see how I got on.

Choosing a battery was fairly easy.  I simple picked the biggest (highest capactiy) leisure
battery that was seemed a reasonable price.  I ended up spending around £100 on a 110Ah 
battery.
