excerpt: An animation showing the comet moving against the background stars
---

An animation made from thirteen 5 minute exposures.  The scope was
tracking the comet and so there are star trails in the individual frames.  The 
thirteen frames were taken in succession and so you see the comet as
it moves against the background stars.

The tail of the comet is just about visible streaming off to the top left
of the image.
