Taken over an hour and three quarters, using a Philips webcam, multiple frames of Jupiter showing the shadow of Ganymede as it transits across the surface of Jupiter.  
In the early frames, the great red spot can be seen on the lower right of Jupiter.
And in the later frames you just make out one of the moons as a few pixels in the lower right of the image.
