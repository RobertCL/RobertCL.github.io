I've not done much astronomy recently, but the skies were clear and Jupiter was
shining brightly in the sky.  I'd not used the webcam for any planetary images
for a long time but it worked out quite nicely.  A few issues getting the focus
correct meant that two of the moons have come out slightly blurred, but the 
detail on Jupiter is some of the best I have managed with my current setup.

The full image is actually a composite of 3 images.  It's necessary to take the 
planet at one exposure and the moons at another otherwise you get no surface
detail on the planet.  I needed two images to get all of the moons in becase they
are spaced too far apart to fit in a single frame from my webcam.
